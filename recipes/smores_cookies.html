        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable shortening</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together 1/3 cup milk, honey, and vanilla extract in a small bowl. In a large bowl, stir together all-purpose flour, brown sugar, whole-wheat flour, baking soda, and salt. Cut in 1/2 cup cold butter, using a pastry blender, until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in milk mixture just until combined. If needed, knead gently to form a ball. Divide dough into fourths. Wrap each portion in plastic wrap and chill until easy to handle, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 portion of dough into a 6-inch square. Cut into 2-inch squares. Arrange 1 inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Prick with a fork. Bake until edges are firm, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove; cool on a wire rack. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>For marshmallow icing, stir together marshmallow creme, powdered sugar, and 2 Tablespoons butter in a bowl. Stir in enough milk to reach dipping consistency. Dip cookies into icing, allowing excess to drip off. Arrange on wire racks set over wax paper; let stand until set.</li>
        <li>For chocolate icing, microwave chocolate and shortening in a small bowl, stirring twice, until smooth, about 90 seconds. Spoon about 1 tablespoon melted chocolate over each cookie to coat. Let stand on a wire rack set over wax paper until set.</li>
        <li>For sandwiches: Dip one side of cookie in marshmallow icing. Dip one side of another cookie in chocolate icing; sandwich cookies, icing sides facing in. Let set.</li>
        <li>For half and halfs: Dip half the cookie in the marshmallow icing and half in the chocolate icing. Let set.</li>
    </ol>
